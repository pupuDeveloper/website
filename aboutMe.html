                        <h2>About Me!</h2>
                        <h3>Where are you from?</h3>
                        <p>Im from Finland! I wont go more in depth than that, but I love this place, and will probably
                            stay
                            here my whole life :).</p>
                        <h3>Why game development?</h3>
                        <p>I wanted to make games ever since I played them as a kid. Games mix so many different forms
                            of art
                            in one, so many ways to express oneself and make something not only beautiful but also fun.
                            I did fail to be pro-active myself
                            and start learning early, but im not letting that slow me down!</p>
                        <h3>Other programming/developing?</h3>
                        <p>I am interest generally in computer science. I am still early in my knowledge and studies, so
                            Im open to pretty much
                            any avenue. Game development is something I aim to do some day, but the road there might
                            take me to do other great things.</p>
                        <h3>Other Cool Facts</h3>
                        <p>Im married and have 2 cats.</p>
                        <p>I hit every 9th stairstab that I try on tf2</p>
